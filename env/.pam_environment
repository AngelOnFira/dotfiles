# This file sets environment variables that should be globally set on the system
# That is, across graphical and non-graphical logins, and across all shell types
#
# Note that it is _not_ important to set things like FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND here since
# that is only relevant when using an interactive shell, so we may as well just set
# that directly in the shell config.
#
# Also note that pam_env is _really_ picky about formatting.
# Lines can _either_ be KEY=VALUE (no spaces!)
#  _or_ they can be KEY DEFAULT="VALUE" where VALUE can then have spaces
#  KEY="VALUE" does _not_ work!
